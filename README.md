# This is FinTech Frontier!
- Check out our Devpost: https://devpost.com/software/fintech-frontier-app

## Inspiration:
- Inspired by the intuitive functionality of the Spending Analyzer in the Discover app, we created a web app to help users quickly and easily track their spending habits and follow a set budget.

## What it does:
- This app allows users to track their spending and income, along with implementing a budget. The app also displays their finances in a graph along with categories they can categorize their spending into

## How we built it:
- We built this as a React app using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We used Node.js for the backend, and Chart.js was used for the visual representation of the data.

## Challenges we ran into:
- We had some issues with our ideas as we overestimated how much we could actually complete in the given time of 24 hours.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We were able to display the pie chart and finances in an aesthetically pleasing way.

## What we learned
- We learned how to use a lot of different packages, react, and redux and to successfully implement it into a program.

## What's next for Fintech Frontier App
- We are planning to implement a budget aspect where users can set a budget for themself, and if they meet it, get a small reward from a Discover partner company. Check back later for an update!
